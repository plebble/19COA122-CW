One of the things I would like to bring attention to is the fact that I have
not used matplotlib. I couldn’t get it to take the data effectively, and I
could not manage to incorporate it into my Tkinter GUI. Instead, the bar chart
functionality is completely made by me, and is drawn using tkinter’s canvas.
However if you’re checking that we can use different modules included with
python, I have used; in addition to Tkinter; colorsys and time. These are
used in the HSV colour gradient, and the database logging, respectively.
Another thing I am quite proud of is the switching of the table view, to the
bar chart view, and vice versa.
